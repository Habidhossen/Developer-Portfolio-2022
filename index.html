        <p>
          My one and only mission in 2022 is to become a full-stack web
          developer and at the same time introduce myself as a good web
          developer.

          <h2>Mission</h2>
          <p>
            A full stack developer can handle both the client and server
            software. They can combine technologies and work in co-ordination
            with others in providing the desired results. So my mission is to
            become a full-stack developer in 2022.

          <h2>Vision</h2>
          <p>
            The demand for full-stack developers is high. Thatâ€™s so because
            full-stack developers work with all three layers of the process
            (presentation, logic and database).
          </p>

          <h2>Goals</h2>
          <p>
            A full stack developer is a person who can handle both sides of a
            development project, which are the front end and the back end. So
            our goal is to develop the best project and satisfy our client.
